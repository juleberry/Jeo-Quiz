# Jeo-Quiz
### (app created using JService API)
### [Netlify Live Link] https://jeoquiz.netlify.app/

### Gameplay:
Click "Reveal Random Question" to reveal a random question from the JService API then click "Reveal Answer" to see if you guessed correctly.
We're on the honor system here for now... if you guessed correctly, use the "+" button to increase your score by the question's value.
If you guessed incorrectly, use the "-" button to decrease your score by the question's value.

Future Features:
Increase score by actual question value rather than 100 pts at a time.
